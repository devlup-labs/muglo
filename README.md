#### A website for the students of IIT Jodhpur which serves as a platform for sharing notes

## Tech stack
Google Apps Script is used for the entire project. Google Apps Script allows us to use various services by Google like Google Drive, Google Spreadsheets, G-Mail etc. directly. All these advantages by Google Apps Script have been exploited. It even allows you to deploy the website in its own domain.
